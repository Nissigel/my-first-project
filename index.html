        We are more than 350 people from 30 different countries divided between our headquarters in Berlin and our offices in Los Angeles and Tokyo.

        <h5>Most of us are active musicians, and DJs, and many of us use Live and Push every day. We come from a wide range of cultural and professional backgronnds. Some of us have PhDs, some of us are self-taught, and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared belief that each of us has the skills and knowledge to contribute to something big: helping to shape the future of the music culture.</h5>

        We only work on a few products and we strive to mae them great.

            Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our people what they need to work their magic and grow. We've learned that achieving the best results comes from building teams that are richly diverse, and thus able to explore problems from wider set of perspectives. We don't always agree with each other, but opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.
